# Authentication and Access Control

## Attack Vectors
- Code Injection Attack (Buffer Overrun)
    - Malicious input containing code introduced through valid input data
    - Coding flaw causes the "data" to be executed as code
    - Example: SQL Injection Attack
- Preventing Injection Attacks
    - minimize the attack surface - do not have a lot of APIs that you do not 
    need
    - encryption of all network traffic
    - require authentication on all API endpoints
        - assume frontend is compromised
    - apply more granular authorization levels
        - grant only required authorization

## Authentication and Authorization
- Authentication
    - ensuring a person is who they claim they be
    - to limit access to certain individuals
    - to collect data on individuals' product usage
        - this may make it PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
- Authentication Approaches
    - Knowledge, Possession, Attribute
        - Knowledge: password, PIN ...
            - problems with passwords
                - reuse on multiple sites
                - hard to remember
                - lost password recovery
                - phishing: getting user to give up password
                - stale passwords: not changing passwords
            - passwords are vulnerable
                - HTTPS not in URL bar so put in headers or body
                - do not store passwords on browser or server
                - minimize sending passwords
                - session timeouts 
                - make login process slow
            - tokens are safer
                - timeout built in
                - can store them
                - only work on one server (the one that issued it)
                - can be invalidated on the server
                - very quick to verify
        - Possession: key, card, phone ...
        - Attribute: biometrics, location ...
- Sequence Diagram
    - User: New User Request -> Server: Create credential with hashed password
    - Server: Return cred -> User: Respond with status
    - User: Login Request -> Server: Query credential by username
    - Server: Verify against hashed password -> User: Respond with auth token
- Hashing Passwords
    - When setting user's passwords:
```js
bcrypt
    .genSalt(10)
    .then(salt => bcrypt.hash(password, salt))
    .then((hashedPassword) => {
        // store hashedPassword in database
    });
```
- Token-Exchange Authentication
    - User: Login Request -> Server: Query credential by username for encrypted password
    - Server: Return encrypted password -> User: Return auth token
    - User: Auth Token -> Server: Verify token -> Server: Respond with data
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

## Access Control
- depending who needs to access what
- to limit who has access to information
    - legal requirement in some cases
- users have access only to their info
    - explicit "share" or "publish" actions
- role-based access control (RBAC)
    - ex. when students are registered they gain access
