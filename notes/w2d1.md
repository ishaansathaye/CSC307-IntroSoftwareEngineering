# Modern Javascript; Intro to VCS and Git

## Modern JavaScript
- Classes
    - Define with `class` keyword
    - Constructor function
    - Methods
        - `this` refers to instance
    - `extends` for derived classes
- Exceptions
    - create new exception by extending hte `Error` class
    - Exceptions are caught by Promise.catch, as we ll as try/catch blocks
- Nested Functions
    - can use symbols defined in the outer scope inside the inner function
- First-class functions
    - use them as arguments: `Array.map(fn)`
    - return them as values
    - nested function has access to the scope where it is defined
- Arrow Functions
    - evaluated to a function
- Template Literals with string interpolation
    - evaluated in surrounding scope
- Module Systems
    - CommonJS module system used by NodeJS created in 2009
    - Frontend community adopted CommonJS while waiting for version ES6
