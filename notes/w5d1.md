- Timeline view
- Dependency tracking
- Critical path analysis
- Expensive, hard-to-use tools

## Product Planning Today

- Rough time-frames
- Loose details allow for future discovery
- "Roadmap", not a "Plan"

## Sprint Backlog
- Prioritized stories
- Related Stories
    - Overall spring goal
- Spring Grooming

## The Iron Triangle
- Quality is a function of: Time, Resources, and Schedule


## Estimation: How long will it take?
- Ask an Expert
- Top-Down Authority

    - Planning Poker
