# Coding as a Team: Code Style and Standards

## Prettier
- Code (Re)Formatter
- Does not change meaning of the code
- limited configuration -> opinionated
- easy to adopt and wide consensus

## Configuring Prettier
- In your repo root
- JSON or YAML
- override based on 
    - file extension
    - folder
    - specific file
- check into git

## Linting
- static analysis
- finds
    - common errors, including some runtime errors
    - style violations
    - suspicious code
- like a spelling/grammar checker
