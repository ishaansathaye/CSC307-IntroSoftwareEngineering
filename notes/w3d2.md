# Software Architecture and Design, Modeling and UML

## Software Architecture and Design
- software design: process of defining and implementing software solutions to one or more sets of problems
- software architecture: the structures needed to reason about a software system, which compromises software elements, relations between them, and properties of both
- architectural design: process of identifying and assigning responsibilities for aspects of behavior to various modules of a system

## Types of Models
- Domain Model (Conceptual Model)
    - represents real world objects and behaviors
    - conceptual classes
    - visual dictionary
- Data Model
    - depicts persistent data objects
    - classes, as in OOP
    - names inspired by domain model

### Conceptual Classes
- defined with a symbol (name), intension (idea), extension (examples), 
- does not assume any implementation technology

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)
- Class
    - hidden, attributes (concept), types/data implement, methods (API)
- Associations between classes
    - relationships between classes
    - multiplicity: how many objects can be associated (cardinality)
- Aggregation and Composition
    - aggregation: part of a whole, can exist independently
        - open diamond
    - composition: part of a whole, cannot exist independently
        - filled diamond
- Generalization
    - inheritance
    - derivation
    - parent/class
    - open triangle (arrow) for generalization
