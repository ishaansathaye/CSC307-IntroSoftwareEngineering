# Merging in Git with Conflicts

## Make a branch to work on an issue
- `git checkout -b issue-branch`

## Merge a branch into main
- `git checkout main`
- `git merge issue-branch`
- if main has not changed since the branch was created, the merge will be fast-forward
- if main has changed, there will be a merge conflict

## Merge conflict
- Git fetch before merging to ensure you have the latest changes
- Merge Option 1
    - `git merge issue-branch`
        - this will create some conflicts such as removing code sometimes
- Merge Option 2
    - `git checkout issue-branch`
    - `git merge main`
        - may have conflicts but will be easier to resolve since on your own branch
- Merge Option 3
    - `git checkout issue-branch`
    - `git rebase main`
        - moves the entire branch to the HEAD of another branch
        - may have conflicts but will be easier to resolve since on your own branch
    - `git rebase --continue`
        - continue the rebase after resolving conflicts

## Cherry-pick
- `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`
    - apply a commit from another branch to the current branch
    - useful for applying a hotfix to a release branch
- `git cherry-pick --continue`
    - continue the cherry-pick after resolving conflicts

## Revert
- `git revert <commit-hash>`
    - create a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit
    - useful for reverting a commit that has already been pushed to a shared branch

## Reset
- `git reset --hard <commit-hash>`
    - move the HEAD to a previous commit
    - useful for undoing changes that have not been pushed to a shared branch
