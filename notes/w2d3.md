# Backend Development and REST APIs with Express

## REST APIs
- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
    - GET request to get data
- REpresentational State Transfer
    - a pattern for designing Web APIs
    - resources
        - identified by URL
        - passed as JSON payload of request or response
    - collections
        - sets of resources
- Will be using on Levels 0-2 of Richardson Maturity Model
    - Level 0: Single URI
    - Level 1: Separate URIs for resources
    - Level 2: Use of HTTP methods

## JSON
- JavaScript Object Notation
- Standard format for representing an object as text
- Subtext of JS
- Parsers and formatters available in many languages
    - JSON.parse()
    - JSON.stringify()
- "Object" means POJSO (Plain Old JavaScript Object)
    - no classes or types

## Implementing REST
- A REST request is handled by code which defines an endpoint
- Complete API often requires many endpoints
- Requests are routed by matching URL patterns
    - `/orders/:id`

## CRUD Operations
- Read
    - GET
- Create
    - POST
- Update
    - PUT
- Delete
    - DELETE
- Update (partial)
    - PATCH (apply a patch (edit))

## GET Request
- To get a collection: `GET /orders`
- To get a single resource: `GET /orders/9011`

## POST Request
- To create a resource: `POST /orders`
- Body of request contains data for new resource
- Response contains new resource with ID

## DELETE Request
- To delete a resource: `DELETE /orders/9011`
- Response is empty but resulting state of backend is that resource is deleted

## PUT Request
- To update a resource: `PUT /orders/9013`
- Body of request contains new data for resource
- Response contains updated resource

## Status Codes
- 1xx: Informational
- 2xx: Success
    - 200: OK
    - 201: Created
    - 204: No Content
- 3xx: Redirection
    - 301: Moved Permanently
- 4xx: Client Error
    - 400: Bad Request
    - 401: Unauthorized (really unauthenticated)
    - 403: Forbidden
    - 404: Not Found
    - 405" Method Not Allowed
- 5xx: Server Error
    - 500: Internal Server Error
    - 501: Not Implemented
    - 503: Service Unavailable

## Express
- Runs in NodeJS
- Web server that we can extend using JavaScript
- Initialization steps
    - Create an app
    - Add your routes
    - Call `app.listen()`

## Express Routes
- Route includes
    - HTTP method
    - URL pattern
        - may include patterns
    - Handler function
