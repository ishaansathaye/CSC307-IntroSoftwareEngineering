# MVC Architecture, REST on the Frontend and Promises

## MVC Architecture
- Model
    - maintains data used and manipulated by the app
    - persisted on the server between sessions
- View
    - user interface, rendered from the model
    - provides affordances for user interaction
- Controller
    - handles requests from the view, potentially updating the model
    - responsible for business logic; controls all changes to model
- Client-Side Rendering
    - Model -> View -> Controller
    - needs to be in sync with server-side model

## Javascript Promises
- Used in place of a result that is not immediately available
- Three states
    - Pending -> waiting
    - Fulfilled -> value is ready
    - Rejected -> some error
- Actions when fulfilled or rejected
    - an alternative to callbacks
- Basis of async/await in Javascript

### Make a Promise
```javascript
const delay = 3000;

const cu_later = 
    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve('Im back!');
        }, delay);
    });
```
- Promise constructor
    - `new Promise(fn)`
    - does nothing until the promise is used
- Handler Function
    - `fn(resolve, reject) => { ... }`
    - Call `resolve(value)` when value is ready (computed)
    - Call `reject(error)` if there is a problem

### Promise, then...
- `.then(action)`
    - runs `action(value)` when promise is fulfilled
    - allows for chaining of promises
        - resolved only when action runs
        - resolves to return value of action
- `.catch(action)`
    - runs `handler(error)` when promise is rejected or on JS error
    - catches any exception or rejection in a chain
- **Handler function only runs once**
- Example:
```javascript
getData() // returns promise
    .then((res) => {
        if (res.status != 200 )
            throw new Error("No Data!");
        return res.json();
    })
    .then((json) => setData(json))
    .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
    });
```

## Making HTTP Requests
- `fetch(url, [, options])`
    - makes an HTTP request
    - default method is GET
    - returns a promise in pending state
    - the promise is fulfilled when the client receives a response

## Making a POST Request
- Use `JSON.stringify()` to convert an JS object to JSON format in body
- Be sure to check `res.status` in the response
    - should be 201 for a successful POST

## State Hooks
- used to attach state to a functional component
- state can be mutated anywhere within the component function
- passing a mutator through props to other functions lets them change the state too
- state is initialized on first render

## Effect Hook
- adding a side effect to any function component
- use this to make an HTTP request to load data into state
- function is called once on first render
- with dependencies, it will turn when they change also
