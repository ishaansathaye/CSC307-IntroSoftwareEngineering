# Requirements and User Stories

## What are Requirements?
- a specification of what should be built describes system properties and behaviors which may be a constraint on the development process
- properties and behavior that a product must have to provide value to a stakeholder
- anything that drives design choices

## Techniques for Eliciting Requirements
- Read existing documentation
- Thinking aloud (Thought Experiments)
- Group Workshop (Design Spring)
- UX Mockups Prototypes
- Observe Users
- Online Research

## Documenting Requirements
- One page product brief
- 2-5 pages of key features
- 50 page product requirements document (PRD)
- 250 page specification with screen mockups, state diagrams, data models,...

## Alternative to PRD: Basecamp's Pitch
- describe the problem
- sketches of solution
- rabbit holes: risk of sinking time
- no-gos: what we are not doing

## User Stories
- Three C's: Card, Conversation, Confirmation   
    - Card: short description of feature
    - Conversation: discussion about feature
    - Confirmation: acceptance criteria
