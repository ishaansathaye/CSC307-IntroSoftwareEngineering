# Intro Frontend Development in React.js

## Basic Web Architecture
- Frontend runs on client
    - presentation, interaction
- Backend runs on server
    business logic, database access
- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
    - frontend makes this request (often user initiated)
    - backend receives and generates response

## Web Frameworks
- Frameworks are tied to languages
    - React -> JavaScript
    - Flutter -> Dart

## NPM (Node Package Manager)
- Centralized registry of javascript packages
- Now contains both frontend and backend 
- Defined by package.json file:
```json
{
    "name": "my-app",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "backend.js",
    "type": "module",
}
```
- `name` is used to install package or import symbols
- `main` is the module file that defines the package's exports
- `type` can be "module" or "commonjs" (default)

## NPM Scripts
- Can be run using `npm run`
    - `npm run start` means `npm run start`
- Defined using shell commands
    - depends on OS
- Have access to scripts defined in `node_modules/.bin`

## NPM Workspaces
- allow breaking package into sub-packages
- top level package.json defines workspaces
- each workspace has its own package.json
- can specify which package to target with `npm -w workspace-name`

## Document Object Model (DOM)
- Browser's in-memory data structure
- HTML is also a container for other assets

## React
- Virtual DOM
    - Complexity of DOM manipulation is abstracted
- JSX: embed HTML in JavaScript
- Flux Architecture
    - One way dat flow
    - Components are pure functions that render a DOM subtree
        - View = f(state)
    - Props pass data from parent node to children
- Rendering a Component
    - Everything is Component
    ```jsx
    function Welcome(props) {
        return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
    }
    ```
    - Instantiation
        - name is the prop
    ```jsx
    <Welcome name="CSC 307">
    ```
